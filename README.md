# leetcode
A collection of my LeetCode submissions that may prove useful in future projects

For each solution, I made the following changes to the original code submissions:

- prepended documentation such as module name and problem description - provides information regarding what problem the module is solving
- appended "export default <module_name>" - makes this repo a library of sorts and its modules import-able within future projects
